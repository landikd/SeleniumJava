# Automated QR Code Scanning with Android Studio, Appium, and Selenium

**This repository showcases an automated testing framework designed for mobile applications that utilize QR code scanning.** Built with Android Studio, Appium, and Selenium, this project facilitates the automation of user flows involving QR codes that may have expiration times.

## Features

- **QR Code Scanning Automation:** Automatically triggers and tests QR code scanning within mobile applications.
- **Expiry Handling:** Simulates the scanning of QR codes that have a limited validity period.
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Supports multiple Android emulator configurations to test across different environments.
- **Integration with Selenium:** Combines the power of Selenium with Appium to streamline the end-to-end testing process.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Captures and saves screenshots of scanned QR codes for verification and debugging.
- **Virtual Camera Automation:** In a 3D scene, a picture is placed at the default camera location. As soon as the camera is opened, the QR code is automatically scanned by replacing the image file and the `.posters` file.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Appium** (Ensure the UiAutomator2 plugin is installed)
- **Selenium**
- **TestNG**
- **Android Studio**
